About:
The user plays against the computer in this version of Tic Tac Toe. Using graphs, the computer looks for the best move to play where it maximizes its
chances of winning. Using conditional tests, if the computer has the chance to win it will play that move. Else, if it needs to prevent the user from
winning, it will make sure to do so as well.
