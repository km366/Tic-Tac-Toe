About:

This is an implementation of Tic Tac Toe using the PyGame GUI.

The user plays against the computer in this version of Tic Tac Toe. Using graphs, the computer looks for the best move to play where it maximizes its
chances of winning. Using conditional tests, if the computer has the chance to win it will play that move. At the same time,
it is also capable of preventing the user from winning. There are controls to reset or quit the game. There is an scorecard which keeps track of the score for each active session.
